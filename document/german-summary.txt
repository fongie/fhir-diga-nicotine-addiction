English:

This standard defines new profiles, extensions, and code systems based on the internationally recognized HL7®FHIR® standard, for the purpose of exporting data  in  a  standard  format  by  Digital  Health  Applications  that  treat  nicotine addiction by using methods based in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.  The standard consists of a document together with FHIR artefacts which can be used to implement the standard. There is also an open source Java library available on GitHub (see additional URLs) to facilitate implementation.

The specification provides flexible FHIR resources to export data on a DiGA treatment for one patient at a time. The specification is flexible enough to allow for DiGA manufacturers to suit the treatment data to their needs, while at the same time strictly defining the structure of such a data export by using the Bundle and Composition FHIR resources to make machine-readable interoperability possible.
